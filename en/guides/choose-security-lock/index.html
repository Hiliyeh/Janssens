    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="info"></i>Understanding Home Security</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right lock is one of the most important decisions you can make to protect your home. In Belgium, a burglary occurs every 4 minutes on average. Front doors remain the most common entry point for intruders, which is why investing in quality security hardware is essential.</p>
    <p>However, the lock market can seem confusing: cylinder, multipoint, A2P certification, security levels... How do you navigate through all these technical terms? This comprehensive guide will help you understand the different options and choose the lock that best suits your situation, your door type, and your security needs.</p>
    <p>Remember: even the best lock is only effective if installed correctly on a door that can withstand break-in attempts. A security chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</p>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="list"></i>Types of Locks Explained</h2>
    <p>Before choosing, you need to understand the different lock types available:</p>
    <div class="situations-grid">
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>European Cylinder</h4>
            <p>The most common lock type in Belgium and Europe. Easily recognizable by its distinctive shape with two different lengths on each side. The main advantage: replacement is simple and can be done without changing the entire lock mechanism. Available in different security levels.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Multipoint Lock</h4>
            <p>Locks the door at 3, 5, or even 7 different points along its height. Each locking point significantly increases resistance to forcing. Essential for exterior doors and highly recommended for apartment front doors. Requires professional installation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>A2P Certified Lock</h4>
            <p>The A2P label (Assurance Prévention Protection) is the French standard for lock security, widely recognized in Belgium. Locks are laboratory tested to verify their resistance to break-in attempts using various techniques. The gold standard for home security.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Smart Lock</h4>
            <p>Opens via smartphone app, code, fingerprint, or badge. Ideal for properties needing flexible access control: rental apartments, Airbnb, shared offices. Modern options combine convenience with security, though backup key access is recommended.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Mortise Lock</h4>
            <p>Embedded within the door rather than mounted on the surface. This traditional type offers excellent security when combined with quality cylinders. Commonly found in older Belgian buildings, often compatible with modern high-security cylinders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Surface-Mounted Lock</h4>
            <p>Installed on the door surface rather than embedded. Often used as secondary locks to reinforce security. Visible from inside, which some consider a deterrent. Easy to install on doors where mortise locks aren't possible.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="award"></i>A2P Certification Explained</h2>
    <p>The A2P standard (Assurance Prévention Protection) is the reference for lock security in Belgium and France. Locks are tested by the CNPP (Centre National de Prévention et de Protection) under realistic break-in conditions:</p>
    <div class="a2p-grid">

            </div>
            <h4>A2P 1 Star</h4>
            <p>Resists 5 minutes against attempted break-in. Entry level security, suitable for internal doors or as secondary locks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="a2p-card">

            </div>
            <h4>A2P 2 Stars</h4>
            <p>Resists 10 minutes. Recommended for apartment front doors and houses in low-risk areas. Good balance between security and budget.</p>
        </div>

            </div>
            <h4>A2P 3 Stars</h4>
            <p>Resists 15 minutes. Maximum protection for high-risk properties, isolated houses, or homes with valuables. The gold standard.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="a2p-note"><i data-lucide="info"></i>Important: an A2P lock provides optimal protection only if installed on a reinforced door. A high-security lock on a weak door is like a safe with a cardboard wall.</p>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="lock"></i>Understanding Cylinder Security</h2>
    <p>The cylinder is the heart of your lock – where you insert the key. Its quality directly determines your lock's resistance to manipulation:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Anti-picking pins</strong> - Special pins that resist the most common locksmith techniques. Essential against skilled burglars who prefer discrete entry without visible damage.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Anti-drill protection</strong> - Hardened steel elements that break drill bits. Drilling is a quick and common break-in method that this feature effectively counters.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Anti-snap technology</strong> - Prevents cylinder snapping, a common technique where burglars break the protruding part of the cylinder to access the mechanism.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Anti-bumping design</strong> - Resists the "bump key" technique, where a specially cut key and impact are used to align pins and open the lock.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Protected key profile</strong> - Keys that cannot be duplicated without authorization. Requires a security card to order copies, preventing unauthorized key duplication.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Reinforced housing</strong> - The external casing is made from hardened materials resistant to forced attacks with tools.</span></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="home"></i>Which Lock for Which Situation</h2>
    <p>The ideal lock depends on your specific situation. Here are our recommendations:</p>
    <div class="usage-grid">
        <div class="usage-card">
            <i data-lucide="building"></i>
            <h4>City Apartment</h4>
            <p>3-point or 5-point multipoint lock with A2P 2 star cylinder minimum. Building entrance already provides first security barrier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="usage-card">
            <i data-lucide="home"></i>
            <h4>Detached House</h4>
            <p>A2P 3 star multipoint lock, reinforced strike plate, anti-drill cylinder. Consider reinforced door or armored door.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="usage-card">
            <i data-lucide="map-pin"></i>
            <h4>Isolated Property</h4>
            <p>Maximum security: A2P 3 star lock + armored door + alarm system. Multiple barriers are essential when response time is longer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="usage-card">
            <i data-lucide="warehouse"></i>
            <h4>Cellar / Garage</h4>
            <p>Minimum 3-point lock, anti-drill cylinder. Often neglected but frequently targeted entry points.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="usage-card">
            <i data-lucide="store"></i>
            <h4>Commercial Premises</h4>
            <p>A2P 2 star lock minimum + metal shutter. Consider insurance requirements which often specify security standards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="usage-card">
            <i data-lucide="key"></i>
            <h4>Rental Property</h4>
            <p>Smart lock for easy access management. Change codes between tenants without changing locks.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="door-open"></i>Don't Forget the Door</h2>
    <p>The most secure lock is useless if your door isn't solid. Here's what to verify:</p>
    <div class="situations-grid">
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Door Material</h4>
            <p>Solid wood, steel, or reinforced composite are best. Hollow wood or thin panels can be kicked in regardless of lock quality. Consider replacing if your door is weak.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Door Frame</h4>
            <p>The frame must be as solid as the door. A weak frame can be forced even with the best lock. Reinforce with metal plates if necessary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Strike Plate</h4>
            <p>Where the lock bolts engage. A reinforced strike plate with long screws into the frame studs significantly increases kick-resistance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Hinges</h4>
            <p>Security hinges with non-removable pins prevent the door being lifted off. Essential for outward-opening doors where hinges are exposed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Glass Panels</h4>
            <p>Any glass near the lock is a vulnerability. Consider security film, bars, or replacing with reinforced glass if necessary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Mail Slot</h4>
            <p>Can be used to reach inside and manipulate handles or locks. Install a mail cage or consider moving the mailbox outside.</p>

            <summary>What is the best lock for a front door?<i data-lucide="plus" class="faq-icon"></i></summary>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>For a front door, we recommend a multipoint lock (3 or 5 points) with an A2P 2 star cylinder minimum. For isolated houses or ground floor apartments, consider A2P 3 stars. The lock should be matched to a solid door and reinforced frame for maximum protection.</p></div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Is an A2P lock worth the investment?<i data-lucide="plus" class="faq-icon"></i></summary>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>A2P certification guarantees tested resistance against real break-in attempts. While certified locks cost more, they provide documented protection that basic locks cannot match. For front doors and security-critical applications, A2P certification is strongly recommended.</p></div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I install a security lock myself?<i data-lucide="plus" class="faq-icon"></i></summary>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Simple cylinder replacements can be DIY if you're handy. However, multipoint locks and high-security installations require professional fitting to ensure proper alignment, reinforcement, and function. Poor installation can void warranties and actually reduce security.</p></div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How often should locks be replaced?<i data-lucide="plus" class="faq-icon"></i></summary>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Quality locks can last 15-20 years with proper maintenance. Replace sooner if: keys become difficult to turn, the lock shows signs of forced entry attempt, you've lost keys, or after a burglary. Also consider upgrading if your locks are older basic models without modern security features.</p></div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What's the difference between a lock and a cylinder?<i data-lucide="plus" class="faq-icon"></i></summary>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>The lock is the complete mechanism embedded in or mounted on the door. The cylinder is the part where you insert the key – the "brain" of the lock. Often you can significantly upgrade security by replacing just the cylinder with a high-security version, without changing the entire lock.</p></div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Are smart locks as secure as traditional locks?<i data-lucide="plus" class="faq-icon"></i></summary>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Quality smart locks can match traditional locks in physical security, with added benefits like access logs and remote control. However, they introduce electronic vulnerabilities. Choose reputable brands, use strong passwords, keep firmware updated, and always have a backup key system.</p></div>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>My insurance requires specific lock standards – what do I need?<i data-lucide="plus" class="faq-icon"></i></summary>
            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Check your policy carefully. Many Belgian insurers require A2P certified locks for burglary coverage. Some specify star levels based on property type or location. We can assess your current locks and recommend compliant upgrades. Keep purchase receipts and installation certificates.</p></div>

            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Always change or re-key locks when moving in. You don't know who has copies of existing keys – previous owners, their family, contractors, estate agents. This is a basic security measure that's often overlooked. Consider it part of moving costs.</p></div>
