    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="info"></i>Understanding the Problem</h2>
    <p>The emergency locksmith sector unfortunately suffers from an alarming number of fraudulent actors. Each year in Belgium, thousands of consumers fall victim to dishonest locksmiths who exploit their vulnerability during a stressful moment. When you're locked out of your home, especially late at night or during the weekend, clear thinking becomes difficult.</p>
    <p>Scammers have understood this perfectly: they prey on your urgency and stress to charge excessive rates and often perform unnecessary work. The victims often only realize the deception once the invoice is paid, sometimes under threat. It's difficult to think clearly when you're outside in the cold with children waiting or an early morning appointment the next day.</p>
    <p>This guide will help you recognize the warning signs of a locksmith scam, protect yourself before calling, and know what to do if you find yourself in a problematic situation. Prevention is your best weapon against these unscrupulous individuals.</p>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="alert-triangle"></i>Warning Signs of a Scam</h2>
    <p>Scammers use identifiable techniques. Know how to spot these red flags before it's too late:</p>
    <div class="situations-grid">
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Abnormally low phone quote</h4>
            <p>The classic bait: a ridiculously low quote to secure your call. Upon arrival, the bill magically multiplies. "Oh, it's more complicated than expected", "this lock requires special equipment"... Excuses are inexhaustible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Refusal to provide a written quote</h4>
            <p>A scammer refuses to commit in writing. "I have to see it first" is their favorite phrase. Yet a professional can estimate a standard opening over the phone based on your lock type.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Immediate destruction of the lock</h4>
            <p>Without even trying non-destructive techniques, the scammer drills or breaks your lock. Result: you now "must" buy an overpriced lock from him. This is a classic fraud scheme.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>"The lock must be changed"</h4>
            <p>Once your door is open, they claim the lock is "damaged", "worn", or "dangerous to keep". In reality, 95% of locks can be opened without damage by a competent professional.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Refusal to provide a VAT invoice</h4>
            <p>"I'll give you a discount if you pay cash" - this classic phrase hides illegal practice. Without an invoice, you have no legal recourse if there's a problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Threats and intimidation</h4>
            <p>The scammer becomes aggressive when you question the bill. Threats to call the police, refusal to leave, intimidation... A true professional never behaves this way with their clients.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Untraceable phone number</h4>
            <p>Mobile phone numbers, prepaid phones, unverifiable numbers. Serious locksmiths have landlines and traceable contact information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Google Ads flooding</h4>
            <p>Scam companies invest heavily in online advertising to be at the top of results. The first result is not always the most trustworthy.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="search"></i>How Scam Networks Operate</h2>
    <p>It's important to understand how these fraudulent networks work to better protect yourself:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Call centers disguised as craftsmen</strong> - Many "locksmiths" are actually call centers that subcontract work to untrained individuals. They pocket a large percentage of each intervention.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Aggressive SEO and artificial reviews</strong> - They create multiple websites with different names, pay for Google rankings, and publish fake 5-star reviews. Everything is designed to appear legitimate.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Multiplying names</strong> - The same scammer may operate under a dozen different company names. If one gets a bad reputation, they simply create another.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Shell companies</strong> - Companies are sometimes registered in the name of individuals living abroad, making legal action impossible.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Pressure sales techniques</strong> - Once on-site, the scammer uses proven sales techniques: urgency, fear, authority. "You can't spend the night with this lock", "your insurance won't cover you"...</span></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="shield-check"></i>How to Protect Yourself Before Calling</h2>
    <p>Take a few minutes, even in an emergency, to perform these checks:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Verify the VAT number</strong> - Every Belgian business has a VAT number starting with BE. Check it on the FPS Economy BCE database. It takes 30 seconds and can save you from disaster.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Look for a physical address</strong> - A real locksmith has a physical workshop, not just a phone number. Check that the address exists and corresponds to a professional premises.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Read reviews carefully</strong> - Beware of profiles with only 5-star reviews all recent. Real reviews are varied, detailed, and spread over time. Check Trustpilot, Google Maps, Facebook.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Demand the total price by phone</strong> - Insist on getting the complete price including travel, labor, and any possible supplements. An honest professional can estimate a standard opening.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Ask about payment methods</strong> - A serious professional accepts card and issues invoices. "Cash only" is a major red flag.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Check if they have a marked vehicle</strong> - True professionals invest in their image: marked vehicle, uniform, professional tools. Scammers arrive in unmarked cars.</span></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="clipboard-list"></i>When the Locksmith Arrives</h2>
    <p>Even after your checks, stay vigilant during the intervention:</p>
    <div class="situations-grid">
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Request ID</h4>
            <p>Ask to see the professional's ID card. Note their name, first name, and the company's VAT number. A professional will be happy to provide this information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Photograph the lock before</h4>
            <p>Before they touch anything, take clear photos of your lock. This is irrefutable proof in case of intentional damage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Confirm the price</h4>
            <p>Before any intervention, ask for written confirmation of the quoted price. If they refuse or the price has changed, stop everything.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Watch the work</h4>
            <p>Stay present during the entire intervention. A scammer will not dare to intentionally damage a lock under your surveillance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Question any extra charges</h4>
            <p>Every extra charge must be justified. "Special equipment", "unusual lock", "night supplements" must have been announced in advance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Refuse any non-agreed work</h4>
            <p>If they want to change the lock "for your safety", demand a written quote and time to think. Never accept under pressure.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
