    <p>Getting locked out is one of the most stressful everyday situations. Every year in Belgium, thousands of people find themselves standing outside their home after accidentally closing their door with the keys still inside.

    <p>The good news? In the vast majority of cases, a professional locksmith can open your door within minutes, without any damage. This guide explains exactly what to do when you're locked out, how to avoid the many scams in this sector, and how to choose a reliable professional who won't take advantage of your urgent situation.</p>
    <p>Being locked out is stressful, but it shouldn't become a financial disaster. Take the time to read this guide and save the number of a reliable locksmith before you need one – it's the best protection against emergency scams.</p>

    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="lightbulb"></i>First Steps to Take</h2>
    <p>Before calling a locksmith, take 5 minutes to check these points. You might save yourself an unnecessary expense:</p>
    <div class="situations-grid">
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Window left open?</h4>
            <p>Check if an accessible window was left open, even slightly. On the ground floor or via an accessible balcony, this is sometimes the simplest and free solution. Be careful not to put yourself in danger though – climbing is risky.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Spare key?</h4>
            <p>A trusted neighbor, family member, or your building manager might have a spare key. Now is the time to check your contact list. Think of all the people you might have given a spare to over the years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Landlord / Agency?</h4>
            <p>If you're renting, your landlord or real estate agency often has a spare set of keys. Even in the evening or on weekends, try to reach them. Many agents provide an emergency number for such situations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Door just pushed?</h4>
            <p>Sometimes the door isn't really locked. The latch might not be fully engaged. Try gently pushing the door while operating the handle. A firm shoulder push sometimes does the trick if the door wasn't properly shut.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Another access?</h4>
            <p>Garage door, cellar door, back door, garden access... Some homes have multiple entrances. Check all possibilities before calling a locksmith. Don't forget the garage if it connects to the house.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Concierge / Caretaker?</h4>
            <p>In buildings with a concierge or caretaker, they sometimes have a master key or can help you find a solution. They may also know if a neighbor has your spare key.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="alert-triangle"></i>What NOT to Do</h2>
    <p>In the stress of the moment, some people try solutions that make the situation worse. Here's what you should absolutely avoid:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list warning-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="x"></i><span><strong>Never force the lock</strong> - You risk damaging the mechanism, turning a simple opening into a complete lock replacement. What could have been a quick intervention becomes a major repair.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="x"></i><span><strong>Don't use a credit card</strong> - This technique only works in movies. Modern locks are designed to resist this type of attempt. You'll damage your card without results and possibly hurt yourself.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="x"></i><span><strong>Don't break the window</strong> - The cost of replacing a window (especially double glazing) far exceeds that of a locksmith. Not to mention the risk of serious injury from broken glass.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="x"></i><span><strong>Don't try to pick the lock</strong> - Without professional training, you risk breaking pins and permanently jamming the lock. You'll make the locksmith's job harder and more expensive.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="x"></i><span><strong>Don't call the first Google result</strong> - Scams are frequent in this sector. Take time to verify the locksmith, even in an emergency. A few minutes of verification can save you significant money.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="x"></i><span><strong>Don't remove the door from hinges</strong> - This rarely works with modern doors and can damage both the door and frame. Leave it to professionals.</span></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="shield-alert"></i>Beware of Scams</h2>
    <p>The emergency locksmith sector is unfortunately plagued by numerous scams. Fraudulent companies take advantage of your stress and urgency to overcharge. Here are the warning signs:</p>
    <div class="situations-grid">
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Very low initial quote</h4>
            <p>"Opening from €29" - These unrealistic prices always hide extras that inflate the final bill: travel, emergency, night, special equipment... The final bill can be several times higher.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>No quote beforehand</h4>
            <p>An honest locksmith always announces their price before starting. Categorically refuse any intervention without an agreed price upfront. "I'll tell you when I see it" is a red flag.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Systematic replacement</h4>
            <p>Some claim the lock is "broken" and needs complete replacement. In 95% of cases, a simple non-destructive opening is sufficient. If they insist on replacement, get a second opinion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Cash only payment</h4>
            <p>A serious professional offers multiple payment methods and provides an invoice with their VAT number. Cash-only demands are a sign of illegal activity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>No identifiable company</h4>
            <p>A real professional has a verifiable business, a physical address, and a website. Be wary of numbers that only appear in ads without any business presence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card warning">
            <h4>Pressure tactics</h4>
            <p>Scammers may try to create urgency: "If I don't do it now, it'll be more expensive tomorrow." A professional respects your right to think and compare.</p>
        </div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="search"></i>How to Choose a Good Locksmith</h2>
    <p>Even in an emergency, take a few minutes to check these essential points. It could save you from a costly scam:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Belgian VAT number</strong> - A legal locksmith has a business registration number (BCE) verifiable on the FPS Economy website. This is the first guarantee of seriousness. No VAT number = illegal business.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Physical address</strong> - Beware of PO boxes or vague addresses. A real craftsman has premises you can verify on Google Maps. A real workshop is a sign of established business.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Price quoted by phone</strong> - Demand a firm price BEFORE the locksmith travels. A serious professional can estimate the cost of a standard opening based on your lock type and time of day.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Reasonable night surcharge</strong> - A surcharge for night or weekend intervention is normal, but should be proportional and announced upfront. Avoid anyone who won't specify the surcharge in advance.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Verifiable Google reviews</strong> - Check online reviews, but beware of profiles with only recent 5-star reviews. Real reviews are varied, detailed, and spread over time. Look for specific details about interventions.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Identified vehicle</strong> - A professional locksmith usually arrives in a vehicle marked with their company name. An unmarked personal car can be a warning sign.</span></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="wrench"></i>How a Professional Opening Works</h2>
    <p>Understanding the process helps you know what to expect from a legitimate professional:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>1. Identity verification</strong> - The locksmith will ask for proof that you live at this address (mail, rental contract, ID card with address, etc.). This is a legal requirement to prevent illegal entry.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>2. Lock diagnosis</strong> - They examine the lock and door to determine the best opening technique. Different locks require different approaches.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>3. Price confirmation</strong> - Before starting any work, they confirm the price agreed by phone. If there's a difference, they must explain why before proceeding.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>4. Non-destructive opening</strong> - Depending on the lock type, they use different techniques: picking, bypass, extraction tools... A skilled locksmith rarely needs to drill or damage the lock.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>5. Lock verification</strong> - Once the door is open, they check that the lock works correctly and hasn't been damaged during the opening.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>6. Proper invoice</strong> - They provide a detailed invoice with their company name, VAT number, and breakdown of services. This is essential for insurance claims.</span></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="clock"></i>Opening Techniques Explained</h2>
    <p>Professional locksmiths have several non-destructive techniques at their disposal:</p>
    <div class="situations-grid">
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Picking</h4>
            <p>Using specialized tools to manipulate the lock's pins, mimicking the action of the key. This requires skill and works on most standard cylinders without any damage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Bump key</h4>
            <p>A specially cut key is inserted and tapped to jostle the pins into position. Quick and effective on many pin tumbler locks, completely non-destructive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Bypass tools</h4>
            <p>Specialized instruments that work around the lock mechanism entirely, often used when the latch hasn't fully engaged. Leaves no trace.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Decoder</h4>
            <p>Advanced tools that read the lock's internal configuration, allowing the locksmith to create a working key or directly manipulate the mechanism.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:1rem">A professional tries all non-destructive methods before considering drilling. If a locksmith wants to drill immediately without trying other techniques, question their competence.</p>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="file-text"></i>Insurance Coverage</h2>
    <p>Good news: your insurance may cover locksmith intervention in certain cases:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Home insurance</strong> - Some contracts include "home emergency" assistance that covers locksmith fees for lockouts. Check the "assistance" section of your policy.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Included assistance</strong> - Check if you subscribed to a "24h assistance" option with your insurance. Many Belgian insurers offer this as a standard or optional add-on.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Premium bank card</strong> - Some Visa/Mastercard Gold or Premium cards include home assistance services, including locksmith coverage.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Keep the invoice</strong> - Even if you're not sure you're covered, always keep the invoice. You can submit a reimbursement request later. A proper invoice is essential for any claim.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Call before if possible</strong> - If you have time, call your insurer's assistance line before the locksmith. They may send their own approved provider.</span></div>

            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes, in 95% of cases a professional locksmith opens the door without any damage using non-destructive techniques like picking, bypass, or specialized tools. Only very high-security locks or damaged mechanisms may require replacement. If a locksmith claims they must drill immediately, get a second opinion.</p></div>
