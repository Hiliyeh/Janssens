    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="info"></i>Understanding the Situation</h2>
    <p>Discovering that your home has been burgled is a traumatic experience. Beyond the material losses, it's your sense of security that is shaken. In Belgium, there are approximately 50,000 burglaries per year, that's nearly 140 per day. You are not alone in this situation, even if it feels that way in the immediate aftermath.</p>
    <p>This guide walks you through managing the aftermath step by step: immediate actions, administrative procedures, and most importantly how to secure your home to prevent recurrence. Unfortunately, statistics show that a burgled home is more likely to be revisited in the following months – burglars know you'll have replaced stolen items with new ones.</p>
    <p>While this is a stressful time, methodically following these steps will help you regain control, get proper insurance compensation, and restore your sense of security at home.</p>

    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="alert-circle"></i>Immediate Steps (In Order)</h2>
    <p>The minutes following the discovery of a burglary are crucial. Here's exactly what you need to do, step by step:</p>
    <div class="situations-grid">
        <div class="situation-card numbered">
            <span class="card-number">1</span>
            <h4>Leave immediately</h4>
            <p>The burglar may still be present. Don't play hero. Exit the premises quietly and call the police from outside or from a neighbor's place. Your safety comes first – possessions can be replaced, you cannot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card numbered">
            <span class="card-number">2</span>
            <h4>Call the police (101)</h4>
            <p>Dial 101 (emergency police number in Belgium). Describe the situation calmly. The police will tell you if and when you can re-enter. Note the report number you'll be given – you'll need it for insurance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card numbered">
            <span class="card-number">3</span>
            <h4>Don't touch anything</h4>
            <p>As difficult as it is, don't clean up or tidy anything. Every moved object may contain fingerprints or DNA evidence. Preserve the crime scene for the police investigation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card numbered">
            <span class="card-number">4</span>
            <h4>Take photos</h4>
            <p>Once the police have completed their investigation, photograph all damage: forced door, broken window, overturned rooms, broken objects. These photos are essential evidence for your insurance claim.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card numbered">
            <span class="card-number">5</span>
            <h4>Make an inventory</h4>
            <p>List all stolen items with maximum detail: brand, model, serial number if possible, approximate purchase value, purchase date. Gather receipts if you have them. Bank statements can help prove purchases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card numbered">
            <span class="card-number">6</span>
            <h4>Secure the entrance</h4>
            <p>If the door or window is damaged, have an emergency locksmith come to secure the home before nightfall. Don't spend the night with an unsecured entry point.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="file-text"></i>Administrative Steps (24-48 Hours)</h2>
    <p>Within 24 to 48 hours following the burglary, several steps are mandatory for insurance coverage:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Official police report</strong> - If not already done, go to the police station to file a formal complaint. You'll receive a report number (process-verbal number) essential for insurance. Request a copy of the police report.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Insurance declaration</strong> - Contact your home insurance within 24 to 48 hours (check exact deadline in your contract). Most insurers have a 24/7 emergency line. Missing this deadline can void your coverage.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Detailed list of stolen items</strong> - Establish a complete list with proof of purchase if possible. Without receipts, photos of items, bank statements, or warranty cards can serve as proof of ownership and value.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Block bank cards</strong> - If your cards were stolen, block them immediately via Card Stop (070 344 344). Also block online access to your bank accounts and change passwords.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Stolen ID documents</strong> - Report the theft to your municipality to block and request new documents. This prevents identity theft and fraud in your name.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Stolen keys = change locks</strong> - Even if the door wasn't forced, change all locks immediately. The burglar may have copied your keys and could return.</span></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="umbrella"></i>Insurance Coverage: What to Know</h2>
    <p>Your home insurance generally covers burglary-related damage, but there are important rules and conditions:</p>
    <div class="situations-grid">
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>What's typically covered</h4>
            <p>Theft of objects, damage to doors and windows, emergency locksmith fees, lock replacement, sometimes temporary rehousing if the home is uninhabitable, and psychological support in some policies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Declaration deadline</h4>
            <p>Generally 24 to 48 business hours after discovery. Check your contract carefully as this deadline varies. Late declaration can result in partial or complete refusal of coverage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Required documents</h4>
            <p>Copy of police report, photos of all damage, detailed list of stolen items with estimated values, purchase receipts or proofs, quotes for repairs and lock replacement.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Excess (franchise)</h4>
            <p>An excess usually applies – the amount that remains at your charge. This varies by contract and may differ for different categories of items. Check your policy for specifics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Coverage limits</h4>
            <p>Most policies have maximum amounts per category (jewelry, electronics, cash, etc.). Valuable items may need to be specifically declared in your policy for full coverage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="situation-card">
            <h4>Expert assessment</h4>
            <p>For larger claims, your insurer may send an expert to assess damage and verify claims. Cooperate fully but feel free to be present during the assessment.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:1rem"><strong>Important tip:</strong> Keep copies of all documents sent to insurance and note the names of people contacted with dates. A paper trail protects you if there are disputes later.</p>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="shield"></i>Securing Your Home After Burglary</h2>
    <p>A burgled home is statistically more likely to be revisited. Burglars know the layout and know you'll buy new equipment. It's crucial to strengthen security immediately:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Change all locks</strong> - This is the absolute priority. Even if the door wasn't forced, the burglar may have found or copied your keys. Opt for high-security cylinders with key copy protection.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Install A2P certified lock</strong> - A2P (Assurance Prévention Protection) locks offer tested resistance against break-ins. Choose A2P 2 stars minimum for your front door – it's worth the investment.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Reinforce the door</strong> - If your door is weak, consider reinforcement plates or replacement with a reinforced door. A good lock on a weak door is useless – the whole system must be secure.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Secure other access points</strong> - Windows, cellar doors, and garages are often neglected but frequently used entry points. Install additional locks, security bars, or reinforced glass where needed.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Alarm system</strong> - An alarm with motion detectors and siren effectively deters return visits. Choose a connected system that alerts you on your smartphone when triggered.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Security cameras</strong> - Visible cameras deter many burglars. Hidden cameras help identify intruders if they do attempt entry. Be aware of GDPR rules for outdoor cameras pointing at public spaces.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Outdoor lighting</strong> - Motion-sensor lights strongly discourage nighttime intrusions. Burglars prefer to work in darkness.</span></div>
    </div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="heart"></i>The Psychological Impact</h2>
    <p>A burglary isn't just material loss. It's an invasion of your private space that can leave lasting psychological effects:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Feeling of violation</strong> - It's normal to feel your privacy has been violated. Strangers went through your personal belongings. This feeling is valid and common among burglary victims.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Feeling of insecurity</strong> - Not feeling safe in your own home is deeply unsettling. This feeling generally fades with time and proper security measures, but don't dismiss it.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Sleep disorders</strong> - Difficulty sleeping, nightmares, hypervigilance at night noises are normal trauma reactions. They usually diminish over time but may need attention if persistent.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Anger and frustration</strong> - Towards the burglars, towards fate, sometimes towards yourself for not having better security. These feelings are natural and part of processing the event.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Don't hesitate to talk</strong> - Share your experience with loved ones. If symptoms persist for weeks, consider professional support. Some insurance policies cover psychological counseling.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Children's reactions</strong> - If you have children, watch for signs of distress. Explain what happened in age-appropriate terms and reassure them about the security measures you're taking.</span></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="service-section">
    <h2 class="service-section-title"><i data-lucide="shield-alert"></i>Preventing Future Burglaries</h2>
    <p>Beyond reinforcing locks, adopt these habits to significantly reduce risks of repeat burglary:</p>
    <div class="advantages-list">
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Simulate presence</strong> - Use timers for lights, TV, and radio when you're away. Burglars strongly prefer empty homes and will usually move on if they think someone is present.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Don't announce absences</strong> - Avoid announcing holidays on social media until you return. Don't let mail pile up – have a neighbor collect it or pause delivery.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Know your neighbors</strong> - A vigilant neighborhood is excellent protection. Exchange phone numbers, notify each other of absences, and report suspicious activity.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Secure valuables</strong> - Install a safe for jewelry, cash, and important documents. Don't leave tempting objects visible from windows or in easily accessible locations.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Photograph your belongings</strong> - Keep photos of valuable items with serial numbers stored securely (cloud backup). This proves ownership and aids recovery if stolen.</span></div>
        <div class="advantage-item"><i data-lucide="check"></i><span><strong>Vary your routine</strong> - Predictable schedules make you an easier target. Vary arrival and departure times when possible.</span></div>

            <div class="faq-answer"><p>Absolutely yes. If the burglar entered without forcing, they may have used a stolen, found, or duplicated key. They could return easily, knowing you'll have bought new equipment to steal. Changing all locks is essential for your safety.</p></div>
