faq_title: "Frequently Asked Questions - Property Landlords"
faqs:
  - q: "Should I change the lock at every tenant changeover?"
    a: "It's not legally required, but strongly recommended. The previous tenant may have made copies. Cylinder replacement (from 89 euros) ensures only the new keys work."
  - q: "How does the master key system work?"
    a: "We install a system where your 'landlord' key opens all your properties, while each tenant has a key that only opens their apartment. Ideal if you manage 3+ properties."
  - q: "Can you respond if my tenant is locked out?"
    a: "Yes, your tenant can call us 24/7. We open without damage and inform you of the intervention. Billing can be to you or the tenant."
  - q: "Do you keep a copy of my keys?"
    a: "No, never. We never keep keys to your properties. We only keep technical references to be able to respond quickly."
  - q: "Do you offer annual contracts?"
    a: "Yes, for landlords with 5+ properties, we offer an annual package including cylinder changes and preferential rates on all interventions."
